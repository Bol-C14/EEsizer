# Legacy scripts (deprecated)

The `scripts/` folder currently only carries historical artifacts. New utilities should live alongside the pipeline or in `eesizer_core` and be installed via `pyproject.toml`. If a script is still needed, move it into a maintained package and add an entry point there.
