# EEsizer (Bol-C14/EEsizer)

EEsizer is a **modular, operator-driven framework** for analog / mixed-signal circuit processing and optimization, designed to support:

* **Safe, auditable netlist transformations**
* **Deterministic simulation/metrics pipelines**
* **Policy-driven optimization loops** (LLM, RL, Bayesian optimization, heuristics)
* Future integration into a broader **Unified Circuit Processor** ecosystem (node transfer, verification copilot workflows, etc.)

> **Key design principle:**
> LLMs (and any “policy”) should **not** directly rewrite netlists.
> They should propose **parameter-only patches** (deltas), which are then applied by strict, deterministic, guard-railed local logic.

## Project Status

This repository has been refactored from a legacy notebook-based codebase into a maintainable package:

* ✅ **Step 1:** Contracts layer (Artifacts / Operators / Policy / Strategy / Errors / Provenance)
* ✅ **Step 2:** SPICE netlist canonicalization + lightweight IR + topology signature guard
* ✅ **Step 3:** Patch substrate (parameter-only editing with topology/schema guards)
* ✅ **Step 4:** Simulation stack (DeckBuildOperator + NgspiceRunOperator + ComputeMetricsOperator + metrics registry)
* 🚧 **Step 5 (in progress):** Strategy/Policy loops (PatchLoopStrategy + heuristic policies in repo)

> The `legacy/` directory contains old code and references.
> New development happens in `src/eesizer_core/`.

---

## Why this architecture?

In research groups and multi-tool environments, the main pain points are:

* repeated “glue” adapters everywhere
* unclear boundaries between parsing, simulation, optimization, reporting
* code that works once but becomes impossible to extend safely (especially with LLM agents)

EEsizer solves this by enforcing:

* **A unified artifact model** (`CircuitSource`, `CircuitIR`, `ParamSpace`, `Patch`, etc.)
* **Composable operators** with consistent `run(inputs, ctx) -> outputs`
* **Strict guards** (topology signature + schema invariants)
* **Auditable provenance** (fingerprints, warnings, run metadata)

## Core Concepts (Quick Mental Model)

### Artifacts (Data)

Artifacts are *typed containers of information* that flow through the system.

Minimal set (already implemented):

* `CircuitSource`: raw netlist text + metadata
* `CircuitIR`: lightweight parsed representation (elements, nodes, token locations)
* `ParamSpace`: whitelist of controllable parameters
* `Patch`: parameter-only delta operations (set/add/mul)
* `SimPlan`: requested simulations (planned for later stages)
* `RunResult`: summary outputs + metrics + logs + provenance (later stages)

### Operators (Functions with contract)

Operators are composable building blocks:

```text
Operator.run(inputs, ctx) -> outputs
```

Operators should be:

* deterministic if possible
* auditable (provenance)
* side-effect-free unless explicitly stated (e.g., running ngspice later)

### Policy (Proposer)

Policy proposes “what to do next”:

* LLM policy
* RL policy
* Bayesian optimization policy
* heuristic policy

```text
Policy.propose(observation, ctx) -> Patch
```

### Strategy (Orchestrator)

Strategy runs a loop by composing operators and policies:

* canonicalize netlist
* apply patch
* simulate
* compute metrics
* stop conditions

```text
Strategy.run(spec, source, ctx, cfg) -> RunResult
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1) Requirements

* Python 3.10+ recommended (3.11 works well)
* (Optional, future) ngspice for simulation stage

### 2) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3) Install EEsizer in editable mode (with dev deps)

From repository root:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For a fully pinned environment, use the lock files:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.lock
pip install -e .
```

### 4) Run tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q
```

> If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: eesizer_core`, it means the package is not installed in editable mode.
> Fix: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and rerun `pytest`.

---

## Dev Container (Recommended)

We support a VSCode Dev Container workflow to avoid environment drift across team members.

1. Install:

* VSCode
* “Dev Containers” extension
* Docker Desktop / Docker Engine

2. Open repository in VSCode
3. Run: **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** (the image builds from `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`)

After container builds, dependencies will install automatically via `postCreateCommand`. If you need to rerun manually:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
PYTHONPATH=src pytest
```

---

## Usage: Canonicalize + Index + Signature (Step 2)

### What Step 2 provides

* **Sanitization**: remove `.control` blocks, restrict `.include` paths (fail-closed for dangerous includes)
* **Indexing**: build a lightweight IR that can locate editable tokens precisely
* **Topology Signature**: a stable fingerprint that changes when and only when **structure** changes

### Canonical netlist pipeline

Typical pipeline (operator layer):

1. `SpiceSanitizeOperator`
2. `IndexSpiceOperator`
3. `TopologySignatureOperator`

This ordering is enforced to prevent inconsistent IR/signature generation.

---

## Usage: Run AC sim + metrics (Step 4)

End-to-end demo (requires `ngspice` on PATH):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python examples/run_ac_once.py
```

This builds an AC deck for `examples/rc_lowpass.sp`, runs ngspice into `examples/output/runs/<run_id>/ac_example`, and computes AC metrics (`ac_mag_db_at_1k`, `ac_unity_gain_freq`). If ngspice is missing, the example will skip gracefully.

---

## Step 3 Recap: Patch Substrate (Parameter-only Editing)

### Motivation

Legacy EEsizer allowed the LLM to rewrite an entire netlist, which can accidentally:

* break topology
* change circuit function
* introduce illegal syntax or unwanted components

We instead enforce:

> The LLM returns only a `Patch` that says “which parameters to change and how”.
> The framework validates and applies it **deterministically** with strict constraints.

### Patch Contract (planned/being implemented)

A `Patch` is a list of operations:

* `param`: `"m1.w"` (must exist in `ParamSpace` and `CircuitIR.param_locs`)
* `op`: `"set" | "add" | "mul"`
* `value`: numeric literal (float/int) or engineering form `"180n"`, `"2u"`, `"1e-6"`
* `why`: optional explanation (recommended for audits)

**Hard rules**

* No netlist rewriting by policy
* No new elements
* No node changes
* Apply must preserve topology signature & schema

---

## Safety & Correctness Guards

We treat these as non-negotiable invariants:

1. **Topology Invariant Guard**

* signature before == signature after

2. **Schema Invariant Guard**

* set of `(element.param_keys)` and `param_locs` must not change

3. **Fail-Closed Input Rules**

* dangerous include paths rejected
* `.control` blocks removed
* indexing rejects non-sanitized input (to avoid parsing junk)

---

## Provenance & Reproducibility

The framework includes:

* `ArtifactFingerprint`: stable hash for artifact identity
* `Provenance`: operator-level trace of transformations
* `RunContext`: run id / seed / notes (foundation for experiment tracking)

Guiding rule:

> Any result should be reproducible from:
> netlist text + patch JSON + tool versions + seed.

---

## How to Extend the Framework

### Add a new Operator

1. Create a new module under `src/eesizer_core/operators/...`
2. Implement the `Operator` protocol:

   * validate inputs
   * call domain pure functions
   * return outputs + provenance
3. Add tests in `tests/`

### Add a new Domain Rule (SPICE)

Keep domain logic in `src/eesizer_core/domain/spice/`:

* no file IO
* no network
* deterministic if possible
* provide small focused functions

### Add a new Policy (LLM/RL/Heuristic)

Add to `src/eesizer_core/policies/` (or similar; not yet standardized):

* must output `Patch`
* must not modify netlist text
* keep prompts/LLM client isolated from domain logic

---

## Testing Guidelines

We use `pytest`.

Recommended test categories:

* `test_spice_sanitize.py`: sanitization correctness + include restrictions
* `test_spice_index.py`: parsing + param locations stable
* `test_ir_signature.py`: signature invariants
* (Step 3) `test_patch_validate.py`: constraints and fail-closed behavior
* (Step 3) `test_patch_apply.py`: deterministic patch application + guards

---

## Common Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: eesizer_core`

Fix:

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest
```

### `.include` is removed or warned

This is intentional. We restrict include paths to avoid unsafe/irreproducible netlist execution.
If you need includes, use controlled relative paths and avoid `..` and absolute paths.

### Signature changes unexpectedly

* check if you changed nodes / element names / models / param keys
* note: signature intentionally ignores numeric values but is sensitive to structure

---

## Roadmap (Short)

* Step 5: Strategy / Policy loops
  * selection of policies (LLM / RL / BO / heuristics)
  * budgets/stop conditions
  * provenance + experiment tracking

* Step 6+: Optimization and deployment
  * richer metrics + corners
  * multi-agent orchestration (policy selection + tool calling)
  * integration toward node transfer workflows

---

## Contributing (Team Workflow)

* Keep `legacy/` read-only
* Add new functionality under `src/eesizer_core/`
* Every new operator/domain rule must have tests
* Prefer small PRs:

  * one invariant / one operator / one test suite at a time
