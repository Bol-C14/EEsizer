# 2026-01-14 13:00 — Step 6 P0 fixes

## Summary
- Added baseline guard/retry handling in PatchLoopStrategy to avoid crashes on iteration-0 sim/metric failures.
- Fixed PatchApplyOperator to respect per-call `include_paths` when recomputing signatures.
- Hardened ngspice runner unit tests by stubbing ngspice executable resolution.

## Files touched
- Code: `src/eesizer_core/strategies/patch_loop/strategy.py`, `src/eesizer_core/operators/netlist/patch_apply.py`
- Tests: `tests/test_ngspice_runner.py`, `tests/test_step6_strategy_handles_baseline_sim_error.py`

## Notes / Rationale
- Baseline measurement now follows the same guard/report discipline as patch iterations.
- Signature checks now consistently honor runtime include settings to avoid drift.
- Unit tests no longer depend on a host ngspice binary.
